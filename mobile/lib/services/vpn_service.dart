//
// Sprint 10.1B — Dart-side MethodChannel client for the Android
// `opene2ee/vpn` MethodChannel. Mirrors the Kotlin handler in
// `MainActivity.kt` / `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt`.
//
// Channel: `opene2ee/vpn` (matches `OpenE2eeVpnService.METHOD_CHANNEL`).
//
// Inbound methods (Dart → Kotlin)
// --------------------------------
//   "start"               → begin capture (caller must have
//                            obtained RESULT_OK from
//                            VpnService.prepare first).
//   "stop"   {graceful}   → tear down + flush ring.
//   "status"              → snapshot of {state, packetsObserved,
//                            ringSize, samplingCap}.
//   "getSampledPackets"   → returns a List<Map<String, Object?>>
//                            produced by `OpenE2eeVpnService`'s
//                            bounded ring buffer; each entry is
//                            the same shape `SampledPacket.toJson()`
//                            produces, so the caller can pipe
//                            them straight into
//                            `TelemetryService.send`.
//   "requestPrepare"      → returns the Android intent action the
//                            activity must `startActivityForResult`
//                            for (handled by MainActivity, exposed
//                            here for convenience).
//
// Outbound methods (Kotlin → Dart)
// --------------------------------
//   "onPacketsSampled" event (Sprint 11.0A) — pushed every 5s
//                          by the service's `PacketDrain` inner
//                          class via the shared `methodChannel`.
//                          Payload is a `List<Map<String, Object?>>`
//                          matching `SampledPacket.toJson()`. Dart
//                          subscribes through [packetStream].
//   "onTelemetry" event   → final flush of the ring + capture
//                          timestamp (legacy 10.1B channel).
//
// Permission flow
// ---------------
// `requestVpnPermission` lives on a SECOND channel
// `opene2ee/vpn_permissions` (handled by MainActivity, not the
// service) — see `MainActivity.kt` §PERMISSIONS_CHANNEL.
