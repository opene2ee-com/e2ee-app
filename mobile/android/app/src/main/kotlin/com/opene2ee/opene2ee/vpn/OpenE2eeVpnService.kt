// PR-22a (Sprint 3) — Android VPN Service — REAL implementation.
// PR-24 (Sprint 4) — moved from `mobile/lib/mobile/vpn/vpn_service_android.kt`
//                    into the Android source tree so Gradle compiles it.
// PR-28 (Sprint 5) — PR-22a follow-up batch:
//                    (B.1) `@RequiresApi(21)` guards around `VpnService.Builder
//                          .allowedApplications()` / `.disallowedApplications()`
//                          call sites (API 21+, Lollipop).
//                    (B.2) Transient service instance handling — companion
//                          singleton so `MainActivity` no longer creates a
//                          throwaway `OpenE2eeVpnService()` instance on
//                          every engine attach/detach. Also switched the
//                          foreground-service lifecycle to
//                          `ServiceCompat.startForeground` with
//                          `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE`.
//                    (B.3) IPv6 transport header parsing stub — was
//                          hard-coded null for srcPort/dstPort/tcpFlags on
//                          IPv6 packets. Now walks past IPv6 extension
//                          headers (limited to no-extension case; documented
//                          below) to extract TCP/UDP ports + flags.
//
// Sprint 11.0A — REAL packet drain → MethodChannel push bridge.
//                The 10.1F inline mock in MainActivity now reads the
//                ACTUAL service ring via the new `OpenE2eeVpnService
//                .snapshot()` static accessor (S46). The service
//                also runs a 5-second scheduled `PacketDrain` inner
//                class that pushes the current ring to Dart via
//                `methodChannel?.invokeMethod("onPacketsSampled",
//                packetsArray)` (S45). A new `companion object`
//                `methodChannel: MethodChannel?` field is shared
//                with MainActivity so the foreground-service
//                notification and the activity can both push events
//                to Dart. The foreground notification text is
//                "OpenE2EE Şifreleme Doğrulama" (no "VPN" string
//                per S25 invariant — S50).
//
// Sprint 11.0D — channel ownership moved BACK to MainActivity.
//                In 11.0A the `opene2ee/vpn` MethodChannel handler
//                was installed by `attachFlutterEngine` in this
//                service — but `attachFlutterEngine` only runs
//                AFTER the service is created (via `onCreate`),
//                and the service is only created on Dart's `start`
//                call. The Dart-side `pool_provider.dart` polling
//                loop calls `vpn.getSampledPackets()` every 5s
//                starting the moment the ActivePoolScreen is
//                first opened — BEFORE `start`. Result: OnePlus 9
//                Pro owner reported `MissingPluginException(No
//                implementation found for method getSampledPackets
//                on channel opene2ee/vpn)`. The fix: handler lives
//                at the activity level (always alive from app
//                launch), delegates to a new
//                `OpenE2eeVpnService.dispatch(context, call, result)`
//                static which routes per-method to the live
//                service OR returns safe defaults (empty ring /
//                IDLE status) when no service is alive yet. The
//                instance `attachFlutterEngine` is preserved (it
//                now sets the companion `methodChannel` for
//                outbound `onPacketsSampled` pushes only — no
//                inbound `setMethodCallHandler`). See S73
//                invariant: `MainActivity.kt` owns the
//                `opene2ee/vpn` MethodChannel handler.
//
// This file is the canonical Kotlin source for the OpenE2EE Android VPN
// service. It lives under `mobile/android/app/src/main/kotlin/` so the
// Android Gradle Plugin picks it up on `./gradlew assembleDebug`. The
// sibling iOS source remains under `mobile/lib/mobile/vpn/NetworkExtension.swift`
// for cross-platform review.
//
// Architecture
// ------------
// - Extends `android.net.VpnService`. The OS hands us a TUN descriptor via
//   `Builder.establish()`; we read packets from it on a dedicated IO thread,
//   extract metadata for the sampling ring buffer, and PROTECT each packet
//   so the system can forward its payload to the real network. We never
//   copy a packet payload off-device — see ADR-0006.
//
// - MethodChannel name: `opene2ee/vpn` (matches Dart-side
//   `kVpnMethodChannel` in `method_channel.dart`).
// - Channel methods from Dart:
//       "start"     → begin session (caller MUST have obtained RESULT_OK from
//                     `VpnService.prepare` first)
//       "stop"      → flush ring + tear down tunnel + stop foreground
//       "status"    → snapshot of {state, packetsObserved, ringSize, samplingCap}
//       "getSampledPackets" → snapshot of the bounded ring
//                              (Sprint 11.0A; replaces the 10.1F
//                              mock packet). Safe to call BEFORE
//                              the service is running — dispatch
//                              returns an empty list.
//       "setAllowedApplications" → restrict VPN to a per-app allowlist
//                                   (Android 5.0+, VpnService.Builder.allowedApplications)
//       "setDisallowedApplications" → inverse — bypass VPN for these apps
//       "requestPrepare" → emit a SystemIntent-style permission prompt
//                           (handled by MainActivity; this service exposes
//                            the helper that returns the intent action)
// - Channel methods TO Dart:
//       "onPacketsSampled" → 5-second scheduled push of the bounded
//                              ring (S45 invariant; Sprint 11.0A)
//       "onTelemetry" → final flush of ring + capture timestamp
//       "onError"     → TUN/protocol errors with a code + message
//
// Per-app VPN (Android 5.0+, API 21+)
// -----------------------------------
// The class accepts an `allowedApplications: List<String>` (package names)
// and an optional `disallowedApplications: List<String>`. Only one of the
// two lists may be non-empty at a time (Android API contract — passing both
// throws `IllegalArgumentException` at Builder.establish() time). The
// lists are applied via:
//   - `Builder.allowedApplications(pkgNames)` to constrain the VPN to a
//     specific set of apps.
//   - `Builder.disallowedApplications(pkgNames)` to bypass the VPN for
//     specific apps while routing everything else through it.
//
// Privacy contract (ADR-0006 — verbatim invariants)
// --------------------------------------------------
// 1. NO raw packet payload is ever copied off-device. The ring buffer
//    stores metadata only: IP/TCP/UDP header fields. Payload bytes are
//    passed back to the OS via `protect()` and dropped.
// 2. NO IMEI, MSISDN, phoneNumber, MAC, contacts are touched. The
//    service MUST NOT call TelephonyManager / WifiInfo /
//    BluetoothAdapter. A grep test in CI asserts this for the
//    `mobile/lib/mobile/vpn/` source tree.
// 3. Source / destination IPs are masked at /24 (IPv4) or /48 (IPv6)
//    before being handed to Dart.
// 4. The TUN interface is read-only on the metadata side; we never
//    inject packets of our own.
//
// Lifecycle / Android 14+ foregroundServiceType
// ---------------------------------------------
// Android 14 (API 34) requires `foregroundServiceType="specialUse"` for
// VPN services that are not classified as "system". The manifest entry
// under `mobile/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` MUST declare
// that type. See ADR-0003 risk B2.

        // accessor, AND runs a 5-second scheduled `PacketDrain` inner
        // class that pushes the current ring to Dart via
        // `methodChannel?.invokeMethod("onPacketsSampled", packetsArray)`.
        //
        // S25 invariant: the foreground notification text is
        // "OpenE2EE Şifreleme Doğrulama" (no "VPN" string). See

         * Behaviour matrix (see [onMethodCall] for the per-method
         * contract preserved from 11.0A):
         *   - `getSampledPackets`: returns activeInstance ring OR
         *     empty list if no service yet. SAFE to call before the
         *     service starts.
         *   - `status`: returns activeInstance status OR the
         *     canonical IDLE status map. SAFE pre-service.
         *   - `start`: uses [context] to launch the foreground
         *     service via [ContextCompat.startForegroundService],
         *     then delegates to the running instance's
         *     [onMethodCall] for the response. This is the missing
         *     piece in Sprint 11.0A — the service was never started
         *     because no one called `startForegroundService` for it.
         *   - `stop`: delegates to active instance, or returns
         *     STOPPED if no service.
         *   - `setAllowedApplications` /
         *     `setDisallowedApplications`: stores on active instance
         *     (or no-ops if no service yet).
         *   - `requestPrepare`: returns the consent Intent action
         *     (the actual consent dialog is owned by

     * Sprint 11.0D — `attachFlutterEngine` is now a NO-OP for

     * MethodChannel handler is owned by `MainActivity`
     * (registered in its `configureFlutterEngine` override,
     * which runs at app launch — BEFORE the VpnService is ever
     * started).
     *
     * Why this changed: in Sprint 11.0A, the handler was set
     * here, BUT the Dart-side `pool_provider.dart` polling loop
     * calls `vpn.getSampledPackets()` immediately when the
     * ActivePoolScreen is first opened (the PoolNotifier is
     * constructed lazily when `ref.watch(poolProvider)` is first
     * read). At that moment the VpnService is NOT yet running
     * (the user has not clicked "Şifreleme Doğrulamayı Başlat"),
     * so the handler was never set, and Dart got
     * `MissingPluginException(No implementation found for
     * method getSampledPackets on channel opene2ee/vpn)`.
     *
     * The MainActivity-owned handler delegates to the
     * [Companion.dispatch] static dispatcher which returns
     * safe defaults when no service is active, OR calls the
     * service's instance methods when the service IS active.
     *
     * The OUTBOUND side of the channel (the `onPacketsSampled`
     * event the 5-second `PacketDrain` pushes to Dart) still
     * needs a [MethodChannel] reference, which is the
     * [Companion.methodChannel] field. We publish the channel
     * from the engine here so the drain can read it without

     * Payload bytes are NEVER copied off-device — only the IP/transport
     * header fields are inspected via [extractMetadata].
     *
     * Sprint 11.0J — passthrough was MISSING pre-11.0J. The pre-11.0J
     * code opened the TUN input stream, read packets, but never
     * wrote them back. Combined with `.addRoute("0.0.0.0", 0)` (default
     * route) this caused the OS to drop ALL the user's internet
     * traffic after 5-30 seconds, triggering a system-side
     * `onRevoke()` and the `state: DRAINING` regression Owner
     * observed on PID 4244 (12:14 logcat). The fix opens BOTH the
     * TUN input stream (read packets from kernel) AND the TUN
     * output stream (write packets back to kernel — kernel then
     * routes them out the real NIC) and writes the SAME bytes
     * back to the output. S80 audit invariant: this is the
     * load-bearing pattern.
